### About me
Working through data every day led me to curiosity in asking many questions. I am passionate about extracting insights and making data-driven decisions. My key skills include experience in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Javascript with basic knowledge of PHP. My previous experience as a web developer and my ability to build web applications and optimize the user experience, adds to my uniqueness as a data scientist.
